# Game Overview:

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a Java-based implementation of the traditional board game "Mill" (also known as Nine Men's Morris) for both single-player and two-player modes. The game should offer a user-friendly graphical interface and adhere to the standard rules of Mill.

## Target Audience:
The game is designed for casual gamers who enjoy strategy board games, and it should be accessible to players of all ages.

# Functional Requirements:

## 1. Game Rules and Logic:
   - The game should follow the standard rules of Mill, including the initial placement phase and the subsequent moving phase.
   - Players should be able to form mills, capture opponent pieces, and win the game by reducing the opponent's pieces to less than three.
   - Proper validation of moves to ensure compliance with game rules.

## 2. User Interface (UI):
   - Create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to:
     - Start a new game.
     - Select game mode (single-player vs. two-player).
     - Make moves by clicking on the board.
     - View the game board and piece positions.
     - Display player turn information.
     - Show game status (ongoing, won, or draw).
   - Implement a visually appealing design with clear instructions and user-friendly controls.

## 3. Game Modes:
   - Implement two game modes:
     - Single-player mode: The player competes against an AI opponent.
     - Two-player mode: Two players take turns on the same device.

## 4. AI Player (Single-player Mode):
   - Develop an AI opponent capable of making strategic moves in single-player mode.
   - The AI should be of varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
   - The AI should be capable of:
     - Forming mills.
     - Blocking opponent mills.
     - Making strategic moves based on game progress.

## 5. Game State Management:
   - Implement game state management, allowing players to:
     - Save the game.
     - Load a previously saved game.
     - Restart the game.

## 6. User Feedback:
   - Provide visual and audio feedback for player actions, such as valid and invalid moves.
   - Display messages for game events (e.g., forming a mill, capturing an opponent's piece).

## 7. Game Statistics:
   - Keep track of game statistics, including:
     - Number of games played.
     - Number of games won by each player.
     - Number of draws.

## 8. Accessibility:
   - Ensure that the game is accessible to players with disabilities by providing options for:
     - Adjusting font size.
     - Enabling audio cues.
     - Supporting keyboard navigation.

## 9. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations, such as crashes or file loading errors.

# Non-Functional Requirements:

## 1. Performance:
   - The game should be responsive and performant, even on lower-end devices.

## 2. Portability:
   - The game should be compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 3. Security:
   - Implement secure data handling and storage, particularly for saved game files.

## 4. Scalability:
   - Design the codebase in a modular and extensible manner to facilitate future enhancements and updates.

## 5. Testing:
   - Thoroughly test the game for correctness, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

## 6. Documentation:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation, including:
     - User manuals explaining how to play the game.
     - Code documentation for developers who may need to maintain or extend the game in the future.

# Development Approach:

## 1. Technology Stack:
   - Use Java as the primary programming language.
   - Utilize a graphics library (e.g., JavaFX) for the GUI.
   - Choose appropriate AI algorithms for the single-player mode.

## 2. Development Timeline:
   - Create a project timeline with milestones and deadlines for each feature.
   - Prioritize core gameplay functionality and then add enhancements and polish.

## 3. Version Control:
   - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with team members if applicable.

## 4. Quality Assurance:
   - Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure a bug-free and enjoyable gaming experience.

## 5. Deployment:
   - Package the game for distribution on various platforms and app stores.

# Conclusion:

In summary, developing a Java-based game of "Mill" requires careful planning and adherence to the outlined functional and non-functional requirements. By following this structured requirements analysis, you can ensure that the final product meets user expectations and offers an engaging gaming experience. Additionally, it's important to maintain flexibility throughout the development process to adapt to potential changes and improvements as needed.
